# ossify

*ossify*, your Spotify listening companion, eases the *tedium* of music discovery and recollection.
The idea is to automate the Radio Jockey experience and keep a record of what you had listened to during your ossify session.

Change songs after a certain (or) random amount of time, get artist and song information via audio feedback during song play.
