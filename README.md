# ossify

Ossify, your Spotify listening companion, eases the *tedium* of music discovery and recollection.
The idea is to automate the RJ(Radio Jockey) experience and keep track of what you had listened to.

Change songs after a certain or random amount of time, get artist and song information via audio feedback during song play.
